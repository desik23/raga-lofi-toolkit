# Raga Lo-Fi Template for Logic Pro X

This guide will help you set up an optimized Logic Pro X template for creating raga-based lo-fi beats efficiently. The template is designed to work seamlessly with the MIDI files generated by our Python tool.

## Template Structure

### 1. Create a New Template Project

1. Open Logic Pro X
2. Create a new project using the "Empty Project" template
3. When prompted, configure the following:
   - Add audio tracks: No
   - Add software instrument tracks: Yes (3)
   - Input/Output: Stereo
   - Sample Rate: 44.1 kHz
   - Project Length: Automatic

### 2. Configure Track Setup

#### Track 1: Melody (Raga Lead)

1. Rename to "Raga Melody"
2. Insert a suitable Indian instrument:
   - **Option 1 (SwarPlug)**: Insert SwarPlug and select Sitar or Bansuri
   - **Option 2 (Kontakt)**: Insert Kontakt 7 with India Discovery Series loaded
   - **Option 3 (Logic Built-in)**: Use EXS24/Sampler with appropriate samples
3. Add effects:
   - Insert → Delay → Tape Delay (20-30% wet, sync to tempo)
   - Insert → Reverb → Space Designer (small room, 15-20% wet)
   - Insert → Distortion → RC-20 (moderate Flux and Wobble settings)
4. EQ settings:
   - Roll off below 150Hz and above 12kHz
   - Slight boost around 1-2kHz for presence

#### Track 2: Chords (Pad/Keys)

1. Rename to "Raga Chords"
2. Insert a suitable instrument:
   - Logic's Alchemy with a pad preset
   - EXS24/Sampler with piano or Rhodes samples
   - Any pad/keys VST you prefer
3. Add effects:
   - Insert → Reverb → ChromaVerb (50-60% wet)
   - Insert → Distortion → RC-20 (focus on Noise and Wear)
   - Insert → Filter → AutoFilter (subtle slow movement)
4. EQ settings:
   - Roll off below 100Hz and above 10kHz
   - Slight dip around 300-500Hz to reduce muddiness

#### Track 3: Bass

1. Rename to "Raga Bass"
2. Insert a suitable bass instrument:
   - Logic's Retro Synth with sine wave
   - EXS24/Sampler with upright bass or 808 samples
   - Any bass VST you prefer
3. Add effects:
   - Insert → Dynamics → Compressor (4:1 ratio, moderate attack)
   - Insert → Distortion → RC-20 (minimal settings, just for warmth)
4. EQ settings:
   - Roll off below 40Hz and above 5kHz
   - Slight boost around 80-100Hz for body

#### Track 4: Drums (Create New Track)

1. Create a new Software Instrument track
2. Rename to "Lo-Fi Drums"
3. Insert a drum sampler:
   - Ultrabeat with lo-fi drum kit
   - EXS24/Sampler with Lo-Fi drum samples
   - XLN Audio XO with appropriate samples
4. Add effects:
   - Insert → Distortion → RC-20 (focus on Noise and Bit Reduction)
   - Insert → Dynamics → Compressor (sidechain setting ready for bass)
   - Insert → Filter → Auto Filter (subtle high cut movement)

#### Track 5: Atmosphere (Create New Track)

1. Create a new Software Instrument track
2. Rename to "Atmosphere"
3. Insert ambient sound source:
   - Alchemy with atmospheric pad
   - Audio file with ambient noise
   - White noise generator
4. Add effects:
   - Insert → Reverb → Space Designer (large hall, 80-100% wet)
   - Insert → Filter → AutoFilter (slow modulation)
   - Insert → Delay → Stereo Delay (long feedback)

### 3. Set Up Master Bus Processing

1. Create an auxiliary track for master bus processing
2. Rename to "Master Bus"
3. Add the following effects:
   - Insert → Dynamics → Compressor (2:1 ratio, slow attack, moderate release)
   - Insert → Distortion → RC-20 (focus on Vinyl noise, subtle settings)
   - Insert → EQ → Channel EQ (slight high cut around 16kHz)
   - Insert → Dynamics → Limiter (ceiling at -1.0 dB)

### 4. Configure Sidechain Compression

1. Set up sidechain from the Kick to the Bass:
   - On the Bass channel, open the Compressor plugin
   - Select Side Chain → Lo-Fi Drums
   - Adjust threshold to taste (usually around -15 to -20 dB)
   - Set fast attack, fast release
   - Ratio 4:1 or higher

### 5. Create Track Stacks (Optional)

For better organization:

1. Select all drum tracks and create a Track Stack (right-click → Create Track Stack → Folder Stack)
2. Name it "Drums"
3. Similarly, consider creating stacks for different instrument sections if needed

## Import Workflow

### Method 1: Drag and Drop

1. Run the Raga Lo-Fi Generator Python tool to create MIDI files
2. Open the Output folder
3. Drag the melody MIDI file onto the Raga Melody track
4. Drag the chord MIDI file onto the Raga Chords track
5. Drag the bass MIDI file onto the Raga Bass track

### Method 2: Import from Logic

1. In Logic Pro X, go to File → Import → MIDI File
2. Navigate to the Output folder from the Raga Lo-Fi Generator
3. Select the MIDI files you want to import
4. Assign each MIDI file to the appropriate track

## Creative Enhancements

- **Add drum loops**: Import royalty-free lo-fi drum patterns or program your own
- **Add vinyl noise**: Use RC-20 or import a vinyl noise audio file
- **Automate filter movements**: Create subtle filter automation for evolving texture
- **Add breaks**: Create short breaks by automating volume or filter cutoffs
- **Layer textures**: Add additional atmospheric elements like field recordings or ambient sounds

## Save as Template

Once you've configured everything:

1. Go to File → Save as Template
2. Name it "Raga Lo-Fi Template"
3. Add a description for easier identification
4. Save in your User Templates folder

Now your template is ready to use for quick lo-fi beat creation!

## Template Variations

Consider creating multiple templates for different purposes:

1. **Morning Ragas Template** - Optimized for bright, energetic ragas like Bhairav
2. **Evening Ragas Template** - Optimized for peaceful ragas like Yaman
3. **Night Ragas Template** - Optimized for introspective ragas like Malkauns

Each can have slightly different instrument choices, EQ settings, and effects to match the mood of the ragas typically used at that time of day.
